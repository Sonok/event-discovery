# Events

This project is something I‚Äôve been thinking about for a while ‚Äî combining social networking with event discovery and recommendations, all powered by AI.

The idea is simple: help people find things they care about, go to more events, and connect with others in the process. It‚Äôs part social, part utility, part machine learning ‚Äî built for users who want more meaningful experiences.
